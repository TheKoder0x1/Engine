To create your own entity you need to look at the pEntity example. It's shit but it shows you 
exactly how to create your entity using this current shit system.

It'll change in a few days but it's still good enough to create entities and only require little change
when the system is finished.

entities MUST implement IEntity
minds MUST implement IMind

Camera controls are

J = Left
I = Up
L = Right
K = Down

Camera doesnt have much use at the moment. Will do soon..
